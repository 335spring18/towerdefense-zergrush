// You are required to have an instruction page. Treat this as a user-guide
// to how to play your game. This guide should be found in the starting menu.

// The form of this can come in a variety of ways but should be within the game.
// No java-pop-ups.

// The minimum expectation is that a new player of your game will have all the
// knowledge of the game mechanics to successfully play once through.

// The player can read the User-Guide of the game anytime before game-play.
